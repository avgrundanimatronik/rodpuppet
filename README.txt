Recommended print settings

Any part not listed below is not in need of any particular settings (supports, brim, layer height etc) and can be printed in whatever settings you deem fitting. I usually go for 0.2mm layer height and 10-15% infill.

Almost any filament material can be used however PETG is recommended.

With custom supports I mean supports not automatically generated. I use PrusaSlicers 'Paint-on' support feature and organic support style with top contact Z distance set to 0.1mm.

If printing with resin I assume you know how to support the print.

BODY AND HEAD
hip.stl - supports needed (custom supports recommended)
torso.stl - supports needed (custom supports recommended) and brim recommended (might be skipped depending on how the supports are placed)
neck.stl - 0.1mm layer height recommended (for easier sanding)
head_fdm_1.stl - supports needed (custom supports recommended)

CONTROLLER
bridge.stl - supports needed
bearing.stl - supports needed (custom supports recommended)
handle_tube_holder.stl - supports needed (custom supports recommended, try to avoid generating supports inside the hole for the PTFE tube)

MISC
There is only one part of which 2 are needed: drill_help1.stl
